Go read the correponding README of the converter you want to use, some adds very usefull stuff (but some don't)

Something true for all converter is that you need to install the corresponding libraries (the one imported at the beginning of the code), use pip for that

Quick description of each converter :

-  png2pdf convert mutiple png into a single pdf

-  yt2mp3 convert a yt playlist into mutiple mp3 files :

-  mp42mp3 convert mutiple mp4 file into multiple mp3 (each mp4 file create mutiple mp3 file on its own, one for each audio track)
