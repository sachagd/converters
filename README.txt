Go read the correponding README of the converter you want to use, some adds very usefull stuff (but some don't)

Something true for all converter is that you need to install the corresponding libraries (the one imported at the beginning of the code), use pip for that


Quick description of each converter :

-  png2pdf convert mutiple png into a single pdf

-  yt2mp4 convert multiple yt playlists into mutiple mp4 files

-  mp42mp3 convert mutiple mp4 file into multiple mp3 files (each mp4 file create mutiple mp3 file on its own, one for each audio track)

-  pdf(s)2pdf merge multiple pdf file into a single pdf fike


After cloning the git, execute this command before using any converter in the main diretory of the git : 

- Windows : del /s /q .gitkeep

- MacOS : find yourself

Or delete manually every .gitkeep file in the git
