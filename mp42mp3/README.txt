You need ffmpeg for this one (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Put all mp4 file in the input folder, then execute main.py

Work only for mp4 that have 2 audio tracks, if your mp4 file have a different number of audio track, you can easily modify the code (or ask to chatgpt)

Will not work if you file have a space in its name
